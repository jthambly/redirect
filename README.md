# redirect

Simple redirection page.

&nbsp;

<b>You will need to substitute two values set in the index.html file:</b>

REDIRECT_URL        for the URL you wish to redirect end users<br/>
REDIRECT_TIME       the time in seconds for the redirect to occur

Note: If you are using a container, setting a REDIRECT_URL and REDIRECT_TIME environment variable will substitute upon container startup.
